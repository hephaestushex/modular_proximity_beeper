This folder contains the models for the modular proximity beeper.

3d print the parts, and either once placing all the parts, glue the lid to the base, or use Velcro to be able to open and close the beeper.

Alternatively, simply use the sketches provided and cut out of 5mm thick material, such as foamboard or corrugated cardboard. Refer to the onshape doc
to get placement details
